\section{Problem}

Problem Description : \href{https://codeforces.com/contest/122/problem/A}{https://codeforces.com/contest/122/problem/A}

% Objective section contains what is the problem's objective
\section{Objective}

Given single integer $n$, decide whether that integer considered as lucky number or not. A number is considered to be lucky if that number only contain either 4 or 7. If it's not satisfy the condition, then the number is considered to be almost lucky if that number is divisible by some lucky number. For example, number 47 is a lucky number whereas 48 is not. 94 is an almost lucky number because it's divisible by 47. Print "YES" if $n$ is lucky or at least almost lucky number. Else, print "NO.

% Solution section contains how you approch the problem and your solution
\section{Solution}

We can use brute force approach to find every possible solution by checking whether the given integer $n$ is divisible by 4, 7, 47, 74, 447, 474, 477, 744, 747, or 774. We don't need to check if $n$ is divisible by 77 since 77 is also divisible by 7.
% Code section contains your solution code
